# React Glossary

### npm
A command line tool for handling packages of reusable JavaScript code designed to be shared.

### package.json
A list of dependencies, or what packages are required for a given js application. You can check for its presence by running “npm test” which will return “hotdog”. Running npm init  will create or edit an existing package.json file.

### npm install
Reads the package.json file and downloads the packages from npmjs.com where they are hosted. Will likely result in a dependency tree because the packages have dependencies, which have dependencies etc. To install a package in our local JSON file, run npm install followed by the package name.

### node
A JS runtime, allowing JavaScript to be run locally on your computer, instead of in a browser. A runtime is the period in which a computer is executing or software designed to support the execution of computer programs.

### framework
A standardized way of creating and deploying web applications.

### React
A JS framework with a specific way for designing and structuring a JS app, it offers both performance and composition benefits through its virtual DOM and JS extension, JSX.

### virtual DOM


### Babel
A transpiler that converts JSX into vanilla JS.


### Webpack


### JSX
An extension of vanilla JS similar to html, it follows a declarative writing structure meaning you can express what you want the UI to look like and JSX will take care of the rest.

### declarative vs. imperative(style of programming)
To write imperative code is to write how something is done in detail(written *explicit* steps). Declarative means you write what you would *like* to do. Most JS is imperative. React is considered declarative because you can create the structure of the UI without giving it the explicit commands necessary for DOM manipulation in traditional JS.
